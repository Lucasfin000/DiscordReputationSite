# Discord-Reputation-Site
Personal Vouch website that stores vouches from a channel in discord to a website for storage!

Basically, I saw this guy on flipd selling this for $95 but thought I wanted to recreate it and push it to github for free.
all you have to do is configure the settings, host the bot on a python server, and host the site on any server that supports php

# Setup
As this is free I do not want to hear people asking me about setup questions or asking me to set it up for them.

# What does it do?
All this does is create a command +vouch in your discord server for your vouch channel, everytime someone vouches you it will be stored on this site, so you never have to worry about your rep being deleted again!!!
